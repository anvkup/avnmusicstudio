It's the most common and important question every artist asks: "How much will this cost?"

The truth is, recording a song isn't one single price. It's a process with three main parts: Recording, Mixing, and Mastering. Here’s a clear breakdown to help you budget for your project at our Ranchi studio.

## 1. Recording (Tracking) - The Foundation

This is the process of capturing your performance. You're paying for time in our acoustically treated rooms with a professional engineer using high-end microphones and preamps.

* **Who it's for:** Singers, rappers, bands, and voice-over artists.
* **How it's billed:** Typically by the hour.
* **Pro Tip:** The best way to save money here is to be *rehearsed*. Arrive knowing your lyrics, your chords, and your song structure inside and out.

## 2. Mixing - The "Art" Part

Mixing is where we take all the individual recorded tracks (vocals, guitars, drums) and blend them into one cohesive, professional-sounding song. This involves:
- **Balancing:** Making sure the vocal is clear and the bass isn't too loud.
- **EQ & Compression:** Sculpting the sound of each instrument so it has its own space.
- **Effects:** Adding reverb, delay, and other creative effects to build emotion.

Mixing is a detailed, technical art form that makes the difference between a "demo" and a "record."

## 3. Mastering - The "Final Polish"

Mastering is the final step. We take your single mixed track and make it ready for the world. This includes:
- **Loudness:** Ensuring your song is as loud and impactful as other professional tracks on Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube (matching LUFS standards).
- **Final EQ:** Adding a final layer of polish and "glue" so the song feels balanced.
- **Exporting:** Creating the high-resolution WAV and MP3 files you need for distribution.

### The Bottom Line: How to Budget

A typical single song can take anywhere from 3 to 10 hours of studio time, depending on your preparation and the complexity of the track.

At AVN Music Studio, we pride ourselves on being the most budget-friendly *and* professional studio in Ranchi. We offer custom packages that combine these services to save you money.
