"Can you just master my track?" "Is mixing included?"

These are common questions, and the confusion is understandable. Mixing and mastering are often grouped together, but they are two completely different and equally critical stages of production.

Let's use a simple analogy: **Building a car.**

## What is Mixing? (Building the Car)

Mixing is the process of assembling the car. You have hundreds of parts: an engine (kick drum), a chassis (bass), seats (vocals), wheels (guitars), etc.

A mix engineer's job is to:
* **Assemble the Parts:** Make sure the kick drum and bass (the engine) work together.
* **Balance:** Ensure the vocals (the driver) are in front and not buried by the guitars.
* **Add "Glue":** Use compression and EQ so all the parts feel like they belong in the *same car*.

You end up with a perfectly built, functional, and great-sounding car. But it's not ready for the showroom.

## What is Mastering? (The Polish & Showroom Prep)

Mastering is the final step. It's when you take the fully built car and prepare it for the public.

A mastering engineer's job is to:
* **Wash & Wax:** Apply a final "polish" with EQ and subtle compression to make the *entire song* shine.
* **Check the Specs:** Ensure the car is road-legal. This is mastering for "commercial loudness" (LUFS), making sure your song is as loud and clear as a professional track on Spotify.
* **Uniformity:** If you're making an album, mastering ensures every "car" (song) has the same level of shine and volume.

You can't "master" an unmixed pile of parts. And a perfectly mixed "car" will still look dull in the showroom without that final polish. A great track needs both.
