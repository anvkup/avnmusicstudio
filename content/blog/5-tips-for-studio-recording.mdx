As a music producer in Ranchi, I see artists walk into the studio every day. The most successful sessions aren't just about talent—they're about *preparation*.

If you're booking time at AVN Music Studio (or any studio!), here are 5 tips to guarantee you get a radio-ready track.

## 1. Practice to a Metronome (Click Track)

This is the most important rule. 99% of modern music is recorded to a click track. If your drummer can't keep time with a metronome, or you (as a vocalist) can't stay in the pocket, we will spend most of your expensive studio time just fixing timing errors.

## 2. Know Your Song Inside and Out

A studio is a microscope. It magnifies every small mistake. Make sure your song is **finished** before you arrive.
- Are the lyrics finalized?
- Is the song structure (verse, chorus, bridge) locked in?
- Does every band member know their part?

## 3. Bring Your Own Hard Drive

Studio files are massive. A single 3-minute song can easily be 5GB or more. Don't rely on us to email you the files. Bring a portable SSD or high-speed USB drive to take your session files (stems) with you.

## 4. Rest Your Voice (and Your Body)

Don't party the night before your session. A tired or strained voice is impossible to mix well. Get a full 8 hours of sleep and warm up your vocals before you even leave the house.

## 5. Trust Your Engineer

You hired us for our expertise. When your engineer gives feedback, it's not criticism—it's a technical suggestion to get a better sound. Trust the process and be open to collaboration.
